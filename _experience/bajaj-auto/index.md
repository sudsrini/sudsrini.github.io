<!-- ## Summary

At Bajaj Auto, I worked as a Powertrain Design Engineer & Design Quality Engineer, delivering optimized and manufacturable powertrain systems for both ICE and EV platforms. My role spanned hands-on mechanical design, FEA, and quality improvement leadership, with a focus on manufacturability, cost savings, and cross-functional collaboration. I led the design of engine components, automated CAD workflows, and drove VAVE initiatives, while collaborating with global brands and supplier teams to ensure robust, reliable products. -->

## Highlights
- Led the design and development of crankcases, covers, and gaskets using Siemens NX, ensuring manufacturability and structural integrity
- Automated gasket CAD modeling and validation with NXOpen scripting, reducing design cycle time by 76%
- Conducted 20+ FEA simulations (ANSYS, HyperView) for structural and sealing performance optimization
- Spearheaded VAVE initiatives: clutch cover weight reduction (11%), jet nozzle cost optimization, and parts consolidation, saving $15,000+ annually
- Led root cause analysis on 100+ in-house and 10+ field failures; implemented corrective actions with testing, manufacturing, and supplier teams
- Updated DFMEA, DVP, and DRBFM documents using test insights, enhancing product durability and system reliability
- Collaborated with global brands (Triumph, KTM) to deliver high-performance engine components meeting international standards
