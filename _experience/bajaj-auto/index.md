## Summary

At Bajaj Auto, I led the mechanical design of engine crankcases, gaskets, and covers, optimized components using DFM/DFA, and conducted FEA to ensure product integrity. I collaborated cross-functionally to drive VAVE initiatives, reducing costs, and led 100+ root cause analyses, improving overall product reliability.
