## Summary

At Bajaj Auto, I worked across both design and quality engineering roles, focusing on full-vehicle powertrain systems for internal combustion and electric two- and three-wheelers.  

### Key Achievements:
- Led the design of engine crankcases, gaskets, and covers, generating 2D production drawings and performing tolerance stack-ups to ensure manufacturability.
- Automated gasket CAD modeling and validation checks using NXOpen scripting, reducing design cycle time by 76%.
- Conducted 20+ FEA and contact pressure simulations (ANSYS, HyperView), supporting critical structural and sealing decisions.
- Spearheaded Value Analysis/Value Engineering (VAVE) initiatives — e.g., optimized clutch cover design (11% weight reduction), redesigned oil jets, and adopted alternative gaskets — yielding $15,000+ in annual savings.
- Led root cause analysis for over 100 in-house and 10 field failures, collaborating with quality, testing, and supplier teams to implement corrective actions.
- Updated DFMEA, DVP, and DRBFM documents based on test insights, improving overall product reliability and performance.

## Highlights
- Mechanical design: Siemens NX, CATIA, GD&T, DFM/DFA
- FEA & simulation: ANSYS, HyperWorks
- Process improvements: NXOpen automation, VAVE, DFMEA updates
- Cross-functional teamwork with suppliers, manufacturing, and testing teams
