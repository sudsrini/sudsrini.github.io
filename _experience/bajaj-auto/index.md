## Summary
As a Mechanical Design Engineer at Bajaj Auto Limited, I led the design and validation of engine components (crankcases, covers, gaskets) for high-volume 2W/3W platforms. My work spanned CAD automation, finite element analysis, cost optimization (VAVE), and cross-functional quality improvements, enabling lighter, more reliable, and cost-efficient designs adopted across multiple platforms.


## Process / Key Projects
- **Engine Component Development** – Designed crankcases, covers, and gaskets using Siemens NX, ensuring structural integrity and manufacturability
- **CAD Automation** – Created NXOpen scripts that automated gasket modeling/validation, cutting design cycle time by 76%
- **FEA & Testing** – Ran 20+ structural and sealing FEA simulations; validated with endurance and pressure tests
- **Value Analysis & Engineering** – Reduced clutch cover weight by 11%, optimized jet nozzle design, and consolidated parts, saving $15,000+ annually
- **Quality Engineering** – Conducted RCA on 100+ in-house & 10+ field failures; implemented corrective actions and updated DFMEA/DVP
- **Collaboration with Global OEMs** – Delivered components for Triumph and KTM, meeting international standards

## Results
- Achieved 11% weight reduction in clutch cover (110 g saved)
- Cut gasket design validation time by 76% through automation
- Delivered annual cost savings of $15,000+ via VAVE initiatives
- Strengthened product reliability through systematic RCA and updated DFMEA/DVP
