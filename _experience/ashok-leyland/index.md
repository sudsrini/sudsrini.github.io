# Project 1: BS4 to BS6 Process Alignment

## Objective
Update Work Instruction Sheets (WIS) and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for BS4 engines to meet BS6 emission standards, improving clarity and efficiency in commercial vehicle engine assembly.

## Process
- Reviewed and analyzed existing BS4 engine SOPs
- Incorporated BS6 regulatory changes into WIS and SOPs
- Updated 20+ engine assembly processes to reflect new standards and reduce ambiguity
- Collaborated with engineers and shop-floor personnel to validate changes for real-world application

## Result
- Delivered finalized BS6-compliant SOPs and WIS documentation
- Streamlined engine assembly processes for smoother adoption of BS6 standards
- Improved clarity in assembly instructions, reducing errors and enhancing efficiency

# Project 2: ABS Sensor Issue Resolution

## Objective
Improve the straight-pass rate of vehicles in Road Tests (Speed, Brake, ABS) by reducing high ABS failure rates caused by faulty sensors.

## Process
- Analyzed ABS test data from 150+ vehicles
- Used Pareto analysis to identify failure causes; found 70% linked to faulty sensors
- Discovered that sensors were only tested at the Vehicle Testing Shop (VTS), too late in the process
- Proposed and implemented early-stage sensor testing at the Axle Shop using a market-available ABS sensor tester

## Result
- Reduced late-stage ABS test failures by detecting defects earlier
- Improved straight-pass percentages in Road Tests
- Minimized rework and improved production efficiency through an additional diagnostic stage
