# Project 1: BS4 to BS6 Process Alignment

## Project Overview
Upgraded BS4 engine Work Instruction Sheets (WIS) and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to meet the new BS6 emission standards, enhancing clarity and efficiency in commercial vehicle engine assembly.

## My Role

- Reviewed and analyzed existing BS4 engine SOPs.

- Identified and implemented necessary modifications for BS6 compliance.

- Updated over 20 engine assembly processes by incorporating new standards and streamlining documentation.

- Worked closely with engineers and shop floor personnel to ensure smooth, real-world implementation.

## Highlights / Contributions

- Enhanced assembly documentation for better clarity and compliance with BS6 standards.
  
- Identified that 70% of ABS test failures were due to faulty sensors and proposed early-stage testing in the axle shop.
  
- Introduced a market-available ABS sensor tester to catch defects earlier, improving overall pass rates and reducing rework.


## Outcome / Current Status

- Completed finalized SOPs and WIS documents, successfully aligning engine assembly processes with BS6 regulatory requirements.

- Helped implement an additional ABS sensor checking stage, reducing late-stage test failures and improving production efficiency.

# Project 2: ABS Sensor Issue Resolution

## Project Overview
Improved the straight pass percentage of vehicles in Road Tests (Speed, Brake, ABS) by identifying and addressing high failure rates caused by faulty ABS sensors.

## My Role

- Collected and analyzed ABS test data from 150+ vehicles.

- Developed and interpreted Pareto charts to isolate top failure causes.

- Discovered that 70% of ABS failures were linked to sensors tested too late in the process.

- Proposed the addition of early-stage sensor testing in the Axle Shop.

## Highlights / Contributions

- Proposed and implemented an ABS sensor tester to detect faults earlier.
  
- Added an early-stage sensor checking stage in the Axle Shop, improving defect detection.
  
- Reduced late-stage test failures and minimized production rework.

## Outcome / Current Status

Integrated a new diagnostic and testing process at the Axle Shop, leading to improved pass rates and faster issue resolution in final Road Tests.
