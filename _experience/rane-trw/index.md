## Objective
Optimize the drop-arm painting process by eliminating inefficiencies and improving workflow to increase production output.

## Process
- Performed a detailed time study to measure cycle times and identify bottlenecks
- Analyzed non-value-adding activities that reduced throughput
- Designed and implemented a specialized drying trolley in SolidWorks to streamline the painting workflow

## Results
- Increased process efficiency from 2 to 3 cycles per hour
- Boosted maximum output from 64 to 152 units per hour
- Eliminated key inefficiencies, creating a smoother and more reliable production line
