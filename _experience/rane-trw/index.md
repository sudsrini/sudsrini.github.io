## Summary

During my internship at Rane TRW Steering Systems, I worked closely with the design engineering team to develop and validate critical steering system components.  

### Key Contributions:
- Created and modified CAD models of steering components to improve manufacturability and meet design requirements.
- Conducted tolerance stack-up analysis to ensure robust fit and function within assembly.
- Supported validation testing by preparing documentation and analyzing results to verify performance under load.
- Collaborated with senior engineers to recommend design improvements and cost-effective solutions.

## Highlights
- Gained hands-on experience with automotive steering system design.
- Enhanced skills in CAD, tolerance analysis, and design-for-manufacturing.
- Worked in a cross-functional environment, bridging design and testing.
