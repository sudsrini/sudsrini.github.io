## Overview

### Objective

Improve the efficiency of the drop-arm painting process by identifying bottlenecks and implementing workflow enhancements.

### Methodology

- Performed time studies to quantify cycle times and identify inefficiencies
- 
- Analyzed non-value-adding activities in the workflow
- 
- Proposed and implemented engineering solutions using SolidWorks
- 
- Designed specialized equipment to streamline operations

### Results

- Achieved 50% improvement in cycles per hour (from 2 to 3)
- 
- Increased maximum hourly output from 64 to 152 units
- 
- Successfully eliminated workflow inefficiencies
- 
- Enhanced overall operational efficiency
