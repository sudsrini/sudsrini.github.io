## Summary

As part of the Boeing Advanced Research Collaboration (BARC), I lead the mechanical design for an autonomous cleaning robot for non-destructive inspection (NDI) water cells. These inspection tanks currently require periodic manual cleaning that disrupts operations for 2-3 days. Our goal is to develop a robotic system capable of fully autonomous, efficient cleaning, reducing maintenance frequency and improving overall system availability.

I am responsible for the mechanical design of the robot's packaging, chassis, and cleaning subsystem. This includes developing a modular, low-profile frame that fits within tight tank geometries, integrating mecanum wheel drive for omnidirectional motion, and designing a combined rotating brush + squeegee system to effectively remove fine debris from wet surfaces. The system must balance compactness, durability, and manufacturability while supporting the project's autonomous operational goals.

## Highlights
- Designed compact chassis (8" x 17" x 6") housing drivetrain, power, and cleaning modules
- Engineered brush-and-squeegee mechanism for simultaneous debris agitation and collection
- Created detailed CAD assemblies and technical drawings for fabrication
- Collaborated on material and component selection for chemical and water resistance
- Supported system integration by coordinating with perception, control, and power teams
- Validated fit, clearance, and integration using mechanical simulations and layout reviews
