## Summary

As part of the UW BARC (Boeing Advanced Research Collaboration) research group, I led the mechanical and control system design for an autonomous cleaning bot.  

The system combined:
- A rotating brush + squeegee mechanism for effective debris removal  
- A wireless charging interface for autonomous docking  
- Low-loss power routing and robust electrical load handling

I applied principles of mechatronics and robotics to ensure safe, efficient operation in confined, damp environments. My work included CAD design, prototyping, control development using MATLAB/Simulink, and performance validation, delivering a fully functional prototype ready for further testing and deployment.

## Highlights
- Designed and prototyped mechanical cleaning system (brush, squeegee, drive system)
- Integrated sensors and controllers to enable autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance
- Developed a wireless recharging dock, optimizing power transfer and system reliability
- Collaborated with a cross-disciplinary team, blending mechanical, electrical, and software components
