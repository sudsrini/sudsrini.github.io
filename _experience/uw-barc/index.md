## Summary

As part of UW’s BARC project, I developed a control system using Control Lyapunov and Control Barrier Functions formulated as a Quadratic Program (QP) to ensure safe trajectory tracking for a 2-DOF robotic arm. This project strengthened my cross-disciplinary expertise in mechanical design, robotics, and automation.
