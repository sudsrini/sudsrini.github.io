    <p>Hi! I’m <strong>Sudarsan Srinivasan</strong>, a passionate Mechanical and Product Design Engineer with over 3.5 years of experience in the automotive industry, currently advancing my expertise through a Master’s in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Washington.</p>

    <p>My core strength lies in combining <strong>mechanical design</strong> (CAD, DFM/DFA, GD&T, FEA) with cross-disciplinary capabilities in <strong>mechatronics, robotics, and automation</strong> — building solutions that are not only robust but also intelligent and future-ready.</p>

    <p>At Bajaj Auto, I contributed to full-vehicle programs, driving innovations across engine systems, structural components, and cost-saving initiatives. Now, I’m expanding into <strong>robotics, control systems, and automation design</strong> through projects and research that fuse mechanical engineering with cutting-edge technology.</p>

    <h3>Core Highlights:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mechanical Design: Siemens NX, SolidWorks, CATIA, DFM/DFA, GD&T</li>
        <li>Simulation & Analysis: ANSYS, HyperWorks, FEA, DFMEA, DVP</li>
        <li>Robotics & Controls: MATLAB, Simulink, ROS, Python, C++</li>
        <li>Quality & Optimization: VAVE, cost reduction, design validation, supplier collaboration</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I’m eager to shape the future of mechanical products by blending <strong>design excellence</strong> with <strong>automation intelligence</strong>. Let’s connect!</p>
