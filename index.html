        ## About Me

        Hi! I’m **Sudarsan Srinivasan**, a passionate Mechanical and Product Design Engineer with over 3.5 years of experience in the automotive industry, currently advancing my expertise through a Master’s in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Washington.  

        My core strength lies in combining **mechanical design** (CAD, DFM/DFA, GD&T, FEA) with cross-disciplinary capabilities in **mechatronics, robotics, and automation** — building solutions that are not only robust but also intelligent and future-ready.  

        At Bajaj Auto, I contributed to full-vehicle programs, driving innovations across engine systems, structural components, and cost-saving initiatives. Now, I’m expanding into **robotics, control systems, and automation design** through projects and research that fuse mechanical engineering with cutting-edge technology.

        ### Core Highlights:
        - Mechanical Design: Siemens NX, SolidWorks, CATIA, DFM/DFA, GD&T
        - Simulation & Analysis: ANSYS, HyperWorks, FEA, DFMEA, DVP
        - Robotics & Controls: MATLAB, Simulink, ROS, Python, C++
        - Quality & Optimization: VAVE, cost reduction, design validation, supplier collaboration

        I’m eager to shape the future of mechanical products by blending **design excellence** with **automation intelligence**. Let’s connect!
