  <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi! I'm <strong>Sudarsan Srinivasan</strong>, a passionate Mechanical and Product Design Engineer with over 3.5 years of experience in the automotive industry, currently advancing my expertise through a Master's in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Washington.</p>
  <p>My core strength lies in combining <strong>mechanical design</strong> (CAD, DFM/DFA, GD&T, FEA) with cross-disciplinary capabilities in <strong>mechatronics, robotics, and automation</strong> â€” building solutions that are not only robust but also intelligent and future-ready.</p>
  <p>At Bajaj Auto, I contributed to full-vehicle programs, driving innovations across engine systems, structural components, and cost-saving initiatives. Now, I'm expanding into <strong>robotics, control systems, and automation design</strong> through projects and research that fuse mechanical engineering with cutting-edge technology.</p>
