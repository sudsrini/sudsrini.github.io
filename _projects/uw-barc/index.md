### NDI Inspection - a video

## Overview

As part of the Boeing Advanced Research Collaboration (BARC), I lead the mechanical design for an autonomous cleaning robot for non-destructive inspection (NDI) water cells. These inspection tanks currently require periodic manual cleaning that disrupts operations for 2-3 days. Our goal is to develop a robotic system capable of fully autonomous, efficient cleaning, reducing maintenance frequency and improving overall system availability.

I am responsible for the mechanical design of the robot's packaging, chassis, and cleaning subsystem. This includes developing a modular, low-profile frame that fits within tight tank geometries, integrating mecanum wheel drive for omnidirectional motion, and designing a combined rotating brush + squeegee system to effectively remove fine debris from wet surfaces. The system must balance compactness, durability, and manufacturability while supporting the project's autonomous operational goals.

## Key Contributions

### Mechanical Design & System Integration

- Led mechanical design of compact robot chassis housing drivetrain, power, and cleaning modules

- Engineered a modular, low-profile frame with integrated mecanum wheel drive for omnidirectional motion in tight tank geometries

<!-- - Designed a combined rotating brush-and-squeegee mechanism for simultaneous debris agitation and collection -->

- Created comprehensive CAD assemblies and fabrication-ready technical drawings

- Ensured IP65 compliance by selecting materials and components resistant to water and chemicals

- Validated fit, clearance, and subsystem integration through mechanical simulations and layout reviews


### Cross-functional Collaboration

- Collaborated closely with electronics, controls, software, perception, and power teams for seamless system integration

- Supported material and component selection to meet environmental durability requirements

- Led cross-functional design reviews and maintained thorough technical documentation throughout development
