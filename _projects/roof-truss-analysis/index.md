## Objective
Evaluate the structural performance of a 40 ft Ã— 80 ft roof truss under combined roofing and snow loads using finite element analysis (FEA), and determine whether additional supports are necessary to minimize deflection.


## Process
- Modeled a 2D truss structure representing one of eight assemblies in the roof system
- Applied material properties of Western White Pine (E = 10 GPa, Î½ = 0.3)
- Defined truss elements with a mesh of 13 elements and 21 nodes
- Distributed a uniform load of 150 lbf/ftÂ² (roofing materials + snow) across trusses, resolving into force components
- Simulated two support configurations:
  - **Config 1**: Fixed supports only at truss ends
  - **Config 2**: Additional central vertical support at the bottom chord

## Results
- **Config 1**: Maximum vertical deflection = 3.13 inches at mid-span â†’ excessive sagging risk
- **Config 2**: Maximum vertical deflection reduced to 0.75 inches (76% improvement)

## Recommendation
Recommended adding a central vertical support to ensure stability, reduce long-term sagging, and enhance load distribution without major material increase.
