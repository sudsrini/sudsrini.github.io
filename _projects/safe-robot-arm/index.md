## Project Overview
Developed and implemented a Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) and Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based Quadratic Program (QP) controller for a simulated 2-DOF robotic arm.

## Highlights
- Ensured real-time trajectory tracking while maintaining safety constraints.
- Simulated system performance and verified theoretical guarantees.
- Tools used: MATLAB, Simulink.
