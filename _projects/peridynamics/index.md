## Project Overview
Developed a Peridynamic Continuum Modeling (PCM) approach to model heat transfer in metal quenching processes, addressing the limitations of classical heat transfer theories in direct chill (DC) casting.

## Highlights
- Built and verified a Peridynamic heat transfer model using benchmark steady-state and transient problems
- Compared Peridynamic results with FEM (Finite Element Method) results for validation
- Extended the model to metal quenching applications and studied the temperature profile during quenching using MATLAB
- Found comparable results between Peridynamics and FEM, particularly with smaller time steps and higher node densities
- Achieved good agreement of temperature profiles between Peridynamic and FEM methods
